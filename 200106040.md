###

* I am interested in contributing to Open Source as it is a great way of learning with implementation. Plus one can meet and collaborate with new people. 
* I am also interested in Competitive programming & Design(mainly because of my interest in Web Development), although not as much as other fields.
* Lastly, I am mainly interested in Development, more specifically Web Devlopment, as I don't see the logic of learning Coding without   applying it in real life.

_Although these are my interests as of now, they may change in the future, as I have currently just started exploring these fields and don't know much as compared to others. :)_

###

1. I made a library management system in 12th graade using Java(Netbeans IDE).
2. Other than that I don't have any achievements, and I don't even know if even this counts as one.
3. Nevertheless, I'll fill these lines, just to make an ordered list.
