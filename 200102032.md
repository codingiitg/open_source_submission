## Fields of Interest in Coding:
  1. Machine Learning:
         I like the concept of machines learning patterns and figuring out how to do a required task in an efficient way without us explicitly giving it all the steps to be followed to have the task completed.
 2. Problem solving in coding:
        I love Mathematics and the satisfaction we get when we solve problems which are challenging. And the process of finding the most efficient algorithm to do a particular task being similar to it is all the more worthwhile.
 3. Web Development:
      The very first time I was introduced to the world of coding was through HTML and since then web developing had always been a field I wanted to explore more.
