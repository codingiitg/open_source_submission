## My Interests!

1. **Open Source** :- Open source contributions and practice gives us real world knowledge just from our PC. After learning various languages, frameworks things always boil down to how to use this in real world problems. For me that bridge is open source. I recently started following open source. Currently I am learning to be able to do my first contribution.
1. **Competitive Coding** :- I like the logic making ability of competitive programming and I am gradualling learning more and more concepts in CP!
1. **Web Development** :- I really enjoy webD , and look forward in making great websites (full stack) soon . 
    - I have some experience with FrontEnd Development  I recently made the E-CELL IITG website.
    - I am currently working in an internship where I am learning MERN Stack and will apply that in making their website.
