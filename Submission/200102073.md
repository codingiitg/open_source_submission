1.Open Source: I always wanted to learn everything practically. I am learning a programming language currently so I was hunting for a opportunity like this where I can put my knowledge to use and so  that I can share/gain knowledge with a whole bunch of like-minded people working in projects with them. Contributing on a project or idea which solves real world problems is definetely gives a motivation for me.

2.Competitive Coding: I always like to train my brain and always challenge it with new kind of challenges.I actually love the process of building a logic to solve a coding problem in constrainted time and other constraints.I get fascinated by different algorithms,methods and coding problems .It really improves my logic building skill.I love to get my hands dirty for this and for the pleasure I get when I code for a problem which passes all test cases.



3.Machine Learning : I get very fascinated about Artificial Intelligence especially the importance of it in solving real world problems which can't be solved by humans.I am currently taking minute steps to explore AI. I would also love to explore data science field

4.App Development : I had interest in apps since my childhood I  always wanted to create a app which would be useful for all.
