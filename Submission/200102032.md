## Fields of Interest in Coding:
  1. Machine Learning:
         I like the concept of machines learning patterns and figuring out how to do a required task in an efficient way without us explicitly giving it all the steps to be followed to have the task completed.
 2. Problem solving through coding:
        I love Mathematics and the satisfaction we get when we solve problems those that are challenging. And the process of finding the most efficient algorithm to do a particular task is all the more worthwhile of the time we spend.
 3. Web Development:
      The very first time I was introduced to the world of coding was through HTML and since then web developing had always been a field I wanted to learn more about.
