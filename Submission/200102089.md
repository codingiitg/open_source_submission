## C++ CODE
#### PRINTING SUM OF ASCII VALUES OF MY FULL NAME 
C++ Code:
```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main (void)
{

 string name="SHUBHRADEEP DAS";          //Initializing variable with my name
 int len=name.length();                  //Variable to store string length
 int sum=0;                              //Variable to store ASCII Sum
 
 for(int i=0;i<len;i++)                  //Loop starts
 {
     if(isspace(name[i]))                //Checking White Spaces in the given string
     {
         continue;                      
     }
     else
     {
         sum=(int)name[i]+sum;            //Storing the ASCII Sum
     }
 }
 cout<<"Sum of ASCII values of my name \"SHUBHRADEEP DAS\" = "<<sum;                        //Printing Final Result
 return 0;
}
```

OUTPUT:
```
Sum of ASCII values of my name "SHUBHRADEEP DAS" = 1027
```

## A SHORT DESCRIPTION ABOUT MYSELF
  I have always been interested in coding ever since I wrote my first Hello World code in C in 5th standard. 
  Since then I have learnt various programming languages like **Q-BASIC, C, Java and HTML** .
  After getting into IIT, I have been brushing my skills in these languages and also learning some new languages like **C++ and Python**.
  I always want to learn new skills in coding and brush them to perfection.
